# NOTES
# Only use the "name:" for a project that has a specific name (i.e. "Decibel").  The project name will be formatted with a colon after it.
# If you want to include a project bullet that DOES NOT have a named heading, leave out "name:" and ONLY use "info:" instead
# "link-name" should be used if you want make the name of the project into a link.

- topic: Provenance
  description: We investigate techniques and applications that make data more valuable, from capturing data provenance (a formal history of how data came to be in its present form) to deriving provenance to developing applications that use data provenance. We build tools to facilitate scientific reproducibility and we investigate ways to build systems that are more accountable to the people who develop and use them.
