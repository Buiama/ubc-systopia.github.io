        <h5>Large Page Behavior with PMEM</h5>
	<P>We are working on understanding large page behavior with persistent memory. We evaluate the trade-offs when persistent memory is used as storage versus memory. Understanding these trade-offs will
drive better decision making for file systems designed to optimize performance for applications using
persistent memory.</P>
