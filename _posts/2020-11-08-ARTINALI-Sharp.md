        <h5>ARTINALI#</h5>
        <P>ARTINALI# is a Bayesian-based search and score technique that identifies the critical points at which to instrument a CPS. Given a set of security monitors that observe run-time behavior of the system, a set of specifications that verify the correct behavior of the system, and statistics gathered from fault injection, ARTINALI# discovers a small set of locations and a rich set of specifications that yield full attack coverage with low (memory and time) overhead. We deploy ARTINALI# to construct an intrusion detection system for two classes CPSes, and demonstrate that our technique reduces the number of security monitors by 64% on average, leading to 52% and 69% reductions in memory and runtime overhead respectively.</P>
