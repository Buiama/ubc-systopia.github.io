        <P>
Model checking is a bug finding technique that attempts to
exhaustively explore a model of the system, checking a property
supplied by the user on each of the states in the model. In the Dara
project we are building a blackbox implementation-level model
checker. That is, the checker uses the distributed system
implementation as the model. This allows Dara to be applied to
existing systems and requires much less effort from a developer than
traditional model checking approaches. We are still working on the
Dara prototype. You can find our implementation of Dara on <a href="https://github.com/DARA-Project">GitHub</a>.
